In view of an aging demographic and an increased share of childcare functions being fulfilled by grandparents, intergenerational relations have received heightened attention from psychological and sociological research in recent years [@bengtsonNuclearFamilyIncreasing2001].<!-- weak 1st sentence -->
With regard to personality development, the transition to grandparenthood has been posited as an important developmental task in old age [@huttemanDevelopmentalTasksFramework2014]. However, empirical research into the psychological consequences of this transition is sparse.
Testing hypotheses derived from social investment theory (Roberts & Wood, 2006) in a matched control-group design [see @luhmannStudyingChangesLife2014], we aim to investigate whether the transition to grandparenthood affects the Big Five personality traits and life satisfaction<!-- add a sentence on the structure of WB -->.

## Personality Development in Old Age

## Social Investment Theory

According to social investment theory, normative life events or transitions such as entering the work force or becoming a parent lead to personality maturation through the adoption of new social roles [@robertsEvaluatingFiveFactor2005].
These new roles encourage or compel people to act in a more agreeable, conscientious, and emotionally stable way, and are hypothesized to drive personality development[^f1].  

[^f1]: However, regarding the transition to parenthood, recent evidence failed to empirically support the social investment principle [@asselmannTestingSocialInvestment2020; @vanscheppingenPersonalityTraitDevelopment2016].  

## Grandparenthood

While we could not find studies investigating development of the Big Five over the transition to grandparenthood, there is some (conflicting) evidence on life satisfaction: Past research on associations of grandparenthood with well-being often relied on cross-sectional designs [e.g., @mahneGrandparenthoodSubjectiveWellBeing2014; @triadoGrandparentsWhoProvide2014].
Previous longitudinal studies utilizing panel data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) showed that the birth of a grandchild was followed by improvements to quality of life and life satisfaction only among women [@tanskanenTransitionGrandparenthoodSubjective2019], and only in first-time grandmothers via their daughters [@digessaBecomingGrandparentIts2019].
Several studies emphasized that grandparents actively involved in childcare experienced larger positive effects to life satisfaction [@arpinoGrandparentingEducationSubjective2018; @danielsbackaAssociationGrandparentalInvestment2016; @danielsbackaGrandparentalChildcareHealth2019].
However, fixed effects regression models[^f2] using SHARE data did not find any effects of first-time grandparenthood on life satisfaction regardless of grandparental investment and only minor decreases of grandmothers' depressive symptoms (Sheppard & Monden, 2019).  

[^f2]: Fixed effects regression models exclusively rely on within-person variance [see @bruderlFixedEffectsPanelRegression2015; @mcneishFixedEffectsModels2019].  

In a similar vein, some prospective studies reported beneficial effects of the transition to grandparenthood and of grandparental childcare investment on various health measures, especially in women  [@chungLongitudinalEffectsGrandchild2018; @condonTransitionGrandparenthoodProspective2018; @digessaHealthImpactIntensive2016; @digessaImpactCaringGrandchildren2016].
Again, effects on self-rated health did not persevere in fixed effects analyses as reported in Ates [-@atesDoesGrandchildCare2017] who used longitudinal data from the German Aging Survey (DEAS).

## Current Study

Our study is the first to analyze personality development during the transition to grandparenthood with regards to the Big Five.<!-- restate: first to ... -->
To address the missing and conflicting empirical evidence, we will compare the development of the Big Five personality traits and life satisfaction over the transition to grandparenthood. We adopt a prospective design that tests effects of first-time grandparents against two propensity-score-matched control groups: first, a matched control group of parents (but not grandparents) with at least their oldest child in reproductive age, and, second, a matched control group of nonparents.
Our design addresses selection effects into grandparenthood and controls for average age-related trends in the Big Five traits and life satisfaction.
It also enables us to report effects of the transition to grandparenthood unconfounded by instrumentation effects, which describe the tendency of reporting lower well-being scores with each repeated measurement [@bairdLifeSatisfactionLifespan2010].
We go beyond previous studies utilizing matched control groups [@anusicDoesPersonalityModerate2014; @anusicTestingSetpointTheory2014; @yapDoesPersonalityModerate2012] in that we performed the matching at a specific time point preceding the event and not based on individual survey years.
This design choice ensures that the variables involved in the matching procedure are not influenced by the event [@greenlandQuantifyingBiasesCausal2003; @rosenbaumConsquencesAdjustmentConcomitant1984].
Similar approaches in the study of life events have recently been adopted by Balbo and Arpino [-@balboRoleFamilyOrientations2016], van Scheppingen and Leopold [-@vanscheppingenTrajectoriesLifeSatisfaction2020], and KrÃ¤mer and Rodgers [-@kramerImpactHavingChildren2020].
